# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular AirBnB platform. Users can browse, search, and book rental properties, as well as manage their own listings. The goal is to gain hands-on experience building a real-world web application with modern technologies.

## Project Goals
- Build a responsive web application with user authentication.
- Implement CRUD operations for listings and bookings.
- Integrate a database to store users, listings, and booking data.
- Apply best practices in front-end and back-end development.

## Tech Stack
- **Front-end:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Back-end:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Provide a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface.
- Make property browsing and booking seamless.
- Ensure consistent design patterns across the application.
- Optimize the user journey from search to checkout.

### Key Features
- Property listing with filters and search functionality.
- Detailed property view with images, description, and reviews.
- Simple checkout flow for booking properties.
- User authentication and profile management.

### Primary Pages Overview

| Page Name | Description | Key Features |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
